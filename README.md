### This C-based project, utilizing CVAVR firmware, integrates a weight counter to track cat food levels. When the food descends below a set threshold, the system prompts the firmware to initiate replenishment, maintaining a consistent level. 
Future enhancements may include the addition of a stopper, allowing controlled cat feeding at specified intervals so the cat dosen't get chonk.
